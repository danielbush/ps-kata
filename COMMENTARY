------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 1

First, let's warm up.  For our acceptance tests, we will use cucumber js and webdriver.io.

We'll focus on creating a simplified walking skeleton that developers can use.
Then we may consider how to deploy it to a more realistic architecture that represents
the problem we're trying to solve (agent-based monitoring).

Commits that start with a failing test will be prefixed with CHALLENGE as in "this is
the immediate problem we need to solve".

------------------------------------------------------------

We can run:

  npm test

now and cucumber will give us back our scenario with some helpful
hints about how to implement the step definitions.

We put the first definition in feature/step_definitions/ .

And we decide to re-word the step from 'idle agent' to just 'agent'.
We can make things more complicated later if we have to.

We need an agent and we need it happily running on a target system (a
system we'll be fetching the ps data from).  How to do this?
