Chapter 1

First, let's warm up.  For our acceptance tests, we will use cucumber js and webdriver.io.

We'll focus on creating a simplified walking skeleton that developers can use.
Then we may consider how to deploy it to a more realistic architecture that represents
the problem we're trying to solve (agent-based monitoring).

Commits that start with a failing test will be prefixed with CHALLENGE as in "this is
the immediate problem we need to solve".
